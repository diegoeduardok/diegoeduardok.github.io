My name is Diego Kleiman. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Biophysics and Quantitative Biology in the [Shukla group](https://shuklagroup.org/), at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.

My research is focused on developing machine learning algorithms for enhanced molecular dynamics simulations. I also apply these tools to study plant proteins.
