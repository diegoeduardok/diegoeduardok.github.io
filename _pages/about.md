I am a Ph.D. candidate in Biophysics and Quantitative Biology at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I am a member of the [Shukla group](https://shuklagroup.org/), 

My research is focused on developing machine learning algorithms for enhanced molecular dynamics simulations. I also apply these tools to study plant proteins.
